## Introduction
This API project includes all the documentation and design for the "Bathing Water Quality" dataset from the Fingal County Council, found [here](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/bathing-water-quality).

## About the data
This dataset was received in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format, and was downloaded from [*Bathing Water Quality*](http://data.fingal.ie/datasets/csv/BathingWaterQuality2013.csv).
The dataset describes the results of studies taken of water found at various beaches, and it's quality to bathe in.
100mls were taken from each location, and brought to a lab. The samples were tested for E-Coli and Enterococci.
The CSV file contains 97 rows, the first row is however, a header row, detailing which information falls
into the each column of the dataset.
There are four values on each line, which are as follows:
    - **Beach**:      The beach location that the water was tested.
    - **Date**:       The date that the water was tested.
    - **E_Coli**:     The Amount of E-Coli that was found in the 100ml sample of water taken.
    - **Enterococci**:The Amount of Enterococci that was found in the 100ml sample of water taken.
